# Mod1 Project: Top US MOVIE MARKET
Mod 1 project is to give the CEO insights as to what type of films they should be creating to meet consumer demand. We consolidate the questions to find the most profitable movies and then decide what type of films to produce. Our judgement is based on directors, writers, genres, etc. The project is coded in three parts: (1) Data Cleaning, (2) Data Analysis, and (3) Data Visualization and located in [code](https://github.com/iuniorhsiung/Mod1_project_DN/tree/nate_branch). 

#### Project source/codes
The project is detailed in [Data Source](https://github.com/learn-co-students/dc-ds-111819/tree/master/module-1/project). All required datasets to produce the final outputs in the presentation is located in [data folder](https://github.com/iuniorhsiung/Mod1_project_DN/tree/nate_branch/data). For simplicity, run the [Data_Visualization_NL.ipynb](https://github.com/iuniorhsiung/Mod1_project_DN/tree/nate_branch) independently to produce final outputs.

## Datapull
In this section, [Mod1_project_datapull_Nate.ipynb](https://github.com/iuniorhsiung/Mod1_project_DN/tree/nate_branch) is used to properly pull the zip files from [data folder](https://github.com/iuniorhsiung/Mod1_project_DN/tree/nate_branch/data) and save them as csv files for the further use. 

## Data Cleaning
This sections is used to clean the csv datasets due to duplication, missing values, variables types, inconsistent variable names, etc. The goal is to create a new dataset for movie summary: movie_sum.csv. This file includes movie titles, movie budgets, domestic gross, worldwide gross, genres, ratings, etc. "movie_sum.csv" is the major dataset used for visualization. 

See all the details in [Data_cleaning_NL.ipynb](https://github.com/iuniorhsiung/Mod1_project_DN/tree/nate_branch).

## Data Visualization 
The data visualization section produces the final outputs used in the presentation. We define the profit in two senses: (1) pure profit (domestic gross - movie budge), and (2) dollor returns. It includes the comparisions between profit and major attributes: diretors, writers, and genres. In addition, we concludes that the imdb rating is not a good indicator to make most profitible movie.
